        <p class="title">Introduction</p>
        <p class="explain" >Cats are one of the most popular pets worldwide, known for their playful nature, independence, and unique personalities. Domesticated around 9,000 years ago, cats belong to the family Felidae and are often praised for their grooming habits, agility, and ability to adapt to various environments. They are carnivores by nature, with sharp claws and teeth that help them hunt and survive. Cats communicate through vocalizations like meowing and purring, as well as body language such as tail movements and ear positions. They are also known for their strong territorial instincts and can be solitary or social depending on their individual temperament. </p>

        <p class="title">Etymology & Naming</p>
        <p class="explain" >The English word "cat" originates from Old English "catt," which is thought to have come from the Late Latin word "cattus," first used around the 6th century. This Latin term may have been derived from an unidentified African language, possibly the Nubian word "kaddîska" meaning 'wildcat,' and Nobiin "kadīs." Another theory suggests that the word might have ancient Germanic roots, which then spread into Latin, Greek, Syriac, and Arabic. There is also a potential connection to Uralic languages, like Northern Sámi and Hungarian, referring to female furred animals.<br><br>The English word "puss," extended to "pussy" or "pussycat," has been used since the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch, Low German, Swedish, Norwegian, Lithuanian, or Irish. The etymology of this term is unclear, but it might have originated from a sound used to attract a cat.<br><br>Male cats are commonly called toms or tomcats, or gibs if neutered. Female cats are known as queens or mollies if spayed.<br><br>Young cats are referred to as kittens, and historically, the term "catling" was used.<br><br>A group of cats can be called a clowder, a glaring, or a colony. Cats have a rich and fascinating linguistic history!        </p>

        <p class="title">Taxonomy</p>
        <p class="explain" >The domestic cat's scientific name, Felis catus, was first proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben later suggested the name Felis catus domesticus in 1777. In 1904, Konstantin Satunin introduced Felis daemon for a black cat from the Transcaucasus, which was later identified as a domestic cat.<br><br>
        In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature officially recognized the domestic cat as a distinct species, Felis catus. Further phylogenetic research in 2007 indicated that the modern domesticated subspecies, F. silvestris catus, likely descended from the African wildcat, Felis lybica. In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce also classified the domestic cat as a separate species, Felis catus, following the ICZN's recommendation.<br><br>

        <p class="title">Evolution</p>
        <p class="explain" >The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that has a common ancestor from about 10 to 15 million years ago. The evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45 million years ago. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at 6.46 to 16.76 million years ago. The genus Felis genetically diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago. Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of this genus evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes.  </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="title">Domestication</p>
        <p class="explain" >It was long thought that the domestication of the cat began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC.[33][34] However, the earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC. Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland. Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats. Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.<br><br>

            The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BC. Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern Europe. By the 5th century BC, they were familiar animals around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria. During the Roman Empire, they were introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the beginning of the 1st century AD. By the end of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern Germany.<br><br>
            
            The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC. This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.<br><br>
            
            During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wild. Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, and high intelligence. Their rigorous grooming habits and instinct to bury their bodily waste make them generally much less messy than other domesticated animals. Captive Leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but are not domesticated. House cats may mate with feral cats. Hybridization between domestic and other Felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat in Scotland.<br><br>
            
            Development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century. An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication, as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds. Most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic cats. Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders.</p>
